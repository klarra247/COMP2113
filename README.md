## Code requirements :
1. Generation of random game sets or events
    - The game randomly generates a number from 1 to 100 to choose a random word from the file of word list

2. Data structures for storing game status
    - The game saves and updates the player guess information after every guess.
    - (...) are used as data structures to store the game status
3. Dynamic memory management
    - Iterators and pointers are used for dynamic memory management.
4. File input/output (e.g., for loading/saving game status)
    - The directory has file "wordlist.txt" to save the 5-letter words
    - The fstream library is used to open file and get random words, and update used words.

5. Program codes in multiple files
    - game.cpp, game.h for game playing functions
    - spellcheck.cpp, spellcheck.game for spelling check functions
    - main.cpp for main function
    - Makefile for making main, and cleaning the directory
6. Proper indentation and naming styles & In-code documentation
    - Every functions, variables, structures are named relevantly to their purpose and the code has proper indentation.
